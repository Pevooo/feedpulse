# Graduation Project
### Repository Guidelines
1) Don't push to the main branch directly
2) Create a branch for the task or the change you want to make (This is to reduce conflicts)
3) Creste a pull request with every change you want to commit to the main branch
4) **Unit tests**: We won't be able to handle a lot of functionality without Unit tests
5) Do **NOT** push secrets (ex. api keys)
6) Use meaningful names for commits
7) Struggling with GIT? Ask **Pavly**
