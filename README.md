# Graduation Project
### Repository Guidelines
1) Don't push to the main branch directly without a code review with **Pavly** (unless it's super urgent)
2) Create a branch for the task or the change you want to make (This is to reduce conflicts)
3) **Unit tests**: We won't be able to handle a lot of functionality without Unit tests
4) Do **NOT** push secrets (ex. api keys)
5) Use meaningful names for commits
6) Struggling with GIT? Ask **Pavly**
